\title{Cyber Security Roadmap From Institutional Perspective}

\author{Muhammer KARAMAN, İbrahim ŞİŞANECİ% <-this % stops a space

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
%
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

Nowadays, cyber world has become indispensable through digital technologies are used extensively in all aspects of our lives . Besides many advanteges/facilities coming with the cyber world, mankinds is facing new threads.In this cyberworld, in addition to the classic security needs, every member which is from corporations to individuals needs cyber security. A novel concept \"Insttitiaonal Cyber Security\" is suggested.This article shed light on cyber security institutions to ensure that there is a roadmap. In this article, a roadmap which will shed light on institutions to ensure cyber security is recommended . This roadmap against cyber threats contains cyber security elements such as policies, plans, awareness actities  and works including technical and administrative measures.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}


% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.

Information technology has become pervasive in every way—from our phones and other small devices to our enterprise networks to the infrastructure that runs our economy. Improvements to the security of this information technology are essential for our future. As the critical infrastructures of the United States have become more and more dependent on public and private networks, the potential for widespread national impact resulting from disruption or failure of these networks has also increased.

Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and impact. Adversaries seeking to disrupt the nation’s critical infrastructures are driven by different motives and view cyberspace as a possible
means to have much greater impact, such as causing harm to people or widespread
economic damage. Although to date no cyberattack has had a significant impact on
our nation’s critical infrastructures, previous attacks have demonstrated that extensive vulnerabilities exist in information systems and networks, with the potential for serious damage. The effects of a successful attack might include serious economic consequences through impacts on major economic and industrial sectors, threats to infrastructure elements such as electric power, and disruptions that impede the
response and communication capabilities of first responders in crisis situations.

This cybersecurity R and D roadmap  is an attempt to begin to define a national R\&D agenda that is required to enable us to get ahead of our adversaries and produce the technologies that will protect our information systems and networks into the future. The research, development, test, evaluation, and other life cycle considerations required are far reaching—from technologies that secure individuals and their information to technologies that will ensure that our critical infrastructures are much more resilient. These investments must tackle the vulnerabilities of today and envision those of the future.


\section{Methodology}
The methodology for development an cyber security roadmap  is similar to technology roadmapping because cyberspace grows/changes/develop fast like technological devepments. The methodology for development an cyber security roadmap consist of three phases: preliminary activity, development of the roadmap and follow-up activity.\cite{maughan2009roadmap} 

In the Phase I. Preliminary activity
1. Satisfy essential conditions.
3. Define the scope and boundaries for the roadmap.

Phase II. Development of the Roadmap
1. Identify the “cyber security issues” that will be the focus of the roadmap.
2. Identify the critical cyber security requirements and their targets.
3. Specify the major cyber security areas.
4. Specify the cyber security drivers and their targets.
6. Recommend the technology alternatives that should be pursued.

Phase III. Follow-up activity
1. Critique and validate the roadmap.
2. Develop an implementation plan.

\section{Cyberspace And Cyber Threats }
* The term of security should be re-defined in terms of cyber security with including the components of cyber space and emerging cyber threats. What is more important  than bridging a new term between security and cyber security, is the perception and understanding of the individuals of  institutions about the new aspects of security definition or redefined security term.

Definition of cyberspace "the notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs." \cite{OxfordDictionary:2013}

\subsubsection{Cyber Security}

Definition of cybersecurity in the dictionary,"the state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this"\cite{OxfordDictionary:2013}

To understand the term cybersecurity we must first define the term cyberrisk.

Cyberrisk is not one specific risk. It is a group of risks, which differ in technology, attack vectors, means, etc. We address these risks as a group largely due to two similar characteristics: A) they all have a potential great impact B) they were all once considered improbable.\cite{Barzilay:2013:ISACAOnline}
\subsubsection{Cyber Risk}

Cybersecurity is the sum of efforts invested in addressing cyberrisk, much of which was, until recently, considered so improbable that it hardly required our attention.

\subsubsection{From Information Security to Cyber Security}

\subsubsection{A New Concept Institutional Cyber Security}

* Enforcement of cyber security rules and policies must be met by the institutions and auditing should be taken into consideration whether the  institutions comply with given set of cyber security policies.  Institutions should not have a choice not to be a part of cyber security enforcement process (Needs to be defined).

* The terms of INFOSEC and COMPUSEC are not providing cyber security needs of the institutions. Altough protecting institutional data, providing business continuity and so forth, The Process of Information Security Management  fails to envision, deter, mitigate or prevent some large scale and targetted malwares like fatmall, duqu, stuxnet, and so forth that in other terms what we call Advanced Persistant Threats.

The ITU also defined cyber security broadly as:‘[T]he collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets. Organization and user’s assets include connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored information in the cyber environment. Cybersecurity strives to ensure the attainment and maintenance of the security properties of the organization and user’s assets against relevant security risks in the cyber environment. The general security objectives comprise the following: availability; integrity, which may include authenticity and non-repudiation; and confidentiality.’Many countries are defining what they mean by cyber security in their respective national strategy documents.
\cite{kurt2012cyber}
1.4.1. The Three Dimensions: Governmental, National and  International

Any approach to a NCS strategy needs to consider the ‘three dimensions’ of activity:
the governmental, the national (or societal) and the international. Since the 1990s a
particular trend in public policy theory has focused on the cooperation of different
actors. Initially the focus was on improving the coordination of government
actors (the Whole of Government approach or WoG), particularly between the
departments most involved in stabilisation or peace building operations in places like Afghanistan or Iraq.
\\


To follow a cyber security roadmap is crucial for the critical infrastructures like telecomunications, transportation, health sectors and so forth that form essence and  is part of national security (Referans, Bilge Hoca’nın Makalesi) other governmental sectors like agriculture, forestry that may seem less important in terms of being a criical infrastructure,  , non governmental and private sectors are also inevitably need to track a cyber security roadmap.

Why an institution neeeds a road map?

\subsection{XXX}

\subsubsection{Security perception \& Awareness}
* The relation between habits and security perception should be probed among individuals especially among system administrators.
\subsubsection{XXX}
At both the individual corporate and industry levels, technology roadmapping has
several potential uses and resulting benefits. Three major uses are:
• First, technology roadmapping can help develop a consensus about a set of needs and
the technologies required to satisfy those needs.
• Second, it provides a mechanism to help experts forecast technology developments in
targeted areas.
• Third, it can provide a framework to help plan and coordinate technology
developments both within a company or an entire industry.[51] XXX  restament

XXX 2 tür Roadmapping var .. biz bir  tanesiinin  üzerinden gidelim
This roadmapping consists of three phases:
1. Assessment (i.e., establish assumption, establish regulatory requirements, establish
committed milestones, depict logics and planned activities).
2. Analysis (i.e., identify issues, perform root-cause analysis, and translate issues to
activities).
3. Resolution (develop issue-resolution documents and integrate activities with activity
data sheets).
Although there are some similarities, this roadmapping approach is fundamentally
different (in purpose, scope, and steps) from the technology roadmapping process
addressed by this paper.\cite{garcia1997fundamentals}
